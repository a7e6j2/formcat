>> Introduction

Formcat 1.01 is a class for form validation in client-side.
Its design goal is to generate the javascript for client-side 
validation as easy and flexible as possible.It runs on Smarty 
as a powerful plug-in.

Formcat only runs on Smarty Template Environment
if you have not know the smarty.please visit http://smarty.php.net

Formcat has no function for server-side validation.I suggest to 
use the SmartyValidate for server-side validation. 

>> Installation

To install Formcat:

* Copy the 'formcat.class.php' file and "validators" directory
(lite version don't need to do that)to a place within your php_
include path (or use absolute pathnames when including.)

* Copy all of the plugins to your Smarty plugin directory. 
(located in the plugins/ directory of the distribution.)
